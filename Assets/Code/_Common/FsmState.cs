    Representation of a state in a finite state machine.

    Intended to fully encapsulate graphics, animation, and physics needed for any specific state.
    State is entered and exited without any transitional checks - that is, it is entirely up to the call site to
    handle when transition is/is-not allowed to occur. Instead, it's up to the state to determine what the
    per-frame behavior is (or isn't) as callbacks are provided for regular, fixed, and late updates.
