# Tuning Data
Tuning data is where all the game specific configuration data lives.

Scriptable objects are our config files with, for example, sliders setup for reasonable ranges of values, used by the gameplay code. Note these values are serialized, so they don't change after gameplay is over.

Unity input configuration and any other game wide settings as well.
