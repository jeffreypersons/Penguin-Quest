# Prefabs
`Assets\Prefabs` is where all the _in-game_ prefab assets are located, as opposed to discpline-specific prefabs/variants.

In other words, these prefabs are where art, sound, data, and code is integrated together to form cohesive pieces used in the game scenes.

Thus gluing scripts from `Assets\Code\Game`, sound files from `Assets\Audio`, sprites/prefabs from `Assets\Art`, and tuning data from `Assets\TuningData`.
