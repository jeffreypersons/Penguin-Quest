# Tuning Data
`TuningData` is where all the game specific configuration data lives, as defined by our game-specific scriptable objects, json, or similar.

Scriptable objects are our config files with, for example, sliders setup for reasonable ranges of values, used by the gameplay code. Note these values are serialized, so they don't change after gameplay is over.

Note that this folder is distinct from `UnitySettings`, where all the global-editor specific asset files live.
